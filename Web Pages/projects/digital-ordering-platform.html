        </div>
        <div id="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This is a PowerApps application built for restaurant staff to efficiently capture and manage customer orders. It replaces manual or unstructured order recording with a clear, digital workflow that improves accuracy and speed during daily operations.
                <br>
                The application is part of a two-solution system, designed to integrate with a separate inventory management application. Together, the solutions provide better visibility into order data and inventory usage, helping the restaurant owner make more informed operational and management decisions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="problem">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The restaurant relied on manual and informal methods during daily operations, such as handwritten notes and verbal communication, making it difficult to keep track of customer orders—especially during periods of high traffic. This approach led to inconsistencies in order handling and increased the risk of delayed, incorrect or incomplete orders.
                <br>
                Because orders were processed manually, additional work was required after business hours for the owner to review order history and compile sales data. This manual process also made it challenging to connect order activity with inventory and sales tracking, resulting in inefficient stock monitoring and limited visibility for day-to-day operations and management decisions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                To address these challenges, a Power Apps–based order management application was developed to provide a structured and user-friendly digital ordering process for restaurant staff. The application allows orders to be captured consistently through predefined menus and inputs, reducing reliance on handwritten notes and verbal communication.
                <br>
                Order data is stored in a centralized data source, enabling the restaurant owner to easily review order history and sales information without additional manual processing after daily operations. The solution was designed as part of a two-application system, allowing order data to integrate with a separate inventory management application. This integration establishes a direct link between order activity and inventory usage, improving stock monitoring and providing better operational visibility.
                <br>
                Overall, the solution streamlines front-of-house operations, reduces order errors, and creates a foundation for data-driven management decisions.

            <h2>My Role</h2>
            <p>
                I was responsible for designing and developing the order management application using Microsoft Power Apps. This included translating operational requirements into a structured digital workflow that supports fast and accurate order entry for restaurant staff.
                <br>
                I designed the data structure and logic to ensure orders were stored consistently and could be integrated with a separate inventory management application. I also implemented role-based access to tailor the user experience for staff and management, and configured automation triggers to support downstream processes such as inventory tracking and reporting.
                <br>
                Throughout the project, I focused on usability, data accuracy, and scalability to ensure the solution could support daily restaurant operations and future enhancements.
